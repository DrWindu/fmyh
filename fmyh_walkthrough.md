You and a group of _weird_ prisoners have just been dropped on a ridiculously small and flat world. How can you escape ? Hopefully, a strange ant princess crashed on this same world some time ago ! If only you could fix the ship...

Well, it's going to require some work. But not too much to be honest. You need:
* 10 units of metal
* Some screws
* A bit of magic
* Some food (10 vegetable and 10 meat)

Getting the metal is straightforward. Just interact with the dark grey stuff in the north. You can only grab 4 per day, so go back to the camp and sleep (interact with the fire) to start a new day.

The screws are not too difficult either. Talk to Judith (the woman at the top right of the fire) and ask her if she have seen something strange. Then go talk to the robot (on the left, the topmost character). She will refuse to give you the screws the first time you ask about her arm. Then you need her to like you to ask again. For this, you need to harvest some... metal (she is a robot !). So if you followed the previous step, you should be good to go !

Magic is quite simple. After the first night, a blue-haired character disappear. He is at the far south-east of the map. Find him and ask what he is doing. After some sleep, he should come back to the camp.

Finally, food. The truth is that you start with 16 vegetables and we didn't implement the consumption of resources every night, so no need to grab vegetables. You just need 10 rabbits (meat). They are mostly on the east part of the map. Again, you will need to sleep every 4 rabbits.

Now, just go to the ship, at the far-west (a little bit south) and interact with it. If you missed something, the character should tell it. Congratulation, you beat the game ! No cutscene. Sorry.
